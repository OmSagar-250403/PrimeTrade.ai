## Top 20 Accounts Based on Ranking

The following table presents the **Top 20 Accounts** based on their composite score ranking from a set of 150 records. Each account is associated with a **Port_ID** and a **composite score**, which are used to determine their rank.

### Explanation:

- **Port_IDs**: These are unique identifiers for each account in the dataset. The Port_ID serves as a key to differentiate between accounts.
  
- **Composite Score**: This is a calculated value that likely represents a performance metric or evaluation score for each account. The composite score is used to rank the accounts, with higher scores indicating better performance.

- **Rank**: This is the relative ranking of the accounts based on their composite score. The account with the highest composite score is ranked 1, and the rank increases as the composite score decreases.

### Ranking Overview:
1. **Top Performers**: 
   - Account `4020204877254599680` has the highest composite score of `1.713795`, making it the **top-ranked account** in this list.
